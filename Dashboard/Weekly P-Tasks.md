# Weekly P-Tasks

Priority tasks for the week. Reviewed and updated each Monday (planning) and Friday (review).

## How it works

Each week gets a header with the Monday date. Tasks are listed P1 (critical) through P5 (optional).

**Priority levels**:
- **P1**: Critical, must be done this week (1-2 items max)
- **P2**: High priority, significant impact (1-2 items)
- **P3**: Medium priority, should be done (1-2 items)
- **P4**: Low priority, nice to have (0-1 items)
- **P5**: Optional, time permitting (0-1 items)

**Status markers** (added during Friday review):
- ✅ Done
- 🔄 Carried over to next week
- ❌ Not done / deprioritized
