# Journal Template Reference

When creating a new daily journal, use `templates/daily-note.md` as the base.

Key rules:
- Resolve all date variables (day name, date, month, year)
- Do NOT include raw template syntax
- If **Monday**: append a Weekly Planning section with `[[Weekly P-Tasks]]` link
- If **Friday**: append a Weekly Review section with reflection prompts

## Monday Addition

```markdown
# 🧠 Weekly Planning

[[Weekly P-Tasks]]

#### One word for this week (intention):
-

#### What challenges might come up?
-
```

## Friday Addition

```markdown
# 🧠 Weekly Review

[[Weekly P-Tasks]]

#### What went well?
-

#### What can I improve?
-

#### How do I feel after this week? (energy: _/10)
-
```
